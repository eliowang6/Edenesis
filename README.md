# Edenesis
Edenesis (a fusion of Eden and Genesis) is an open-source research framework for Distributed Swarm Intelligence and Symbolic Evolutionary Computation. It provides a high-performance, multi-dimensional virtual environment where autonomous symbolic agents co-evolve, interact, and emerge complex behaviors from minimalist primal rules.
